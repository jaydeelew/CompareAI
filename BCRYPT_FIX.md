# Bcrypt Password Hashing Fix

## Problem
Registration was failing with error:
```
password cannot be longer than 72 bytes, truncate manually if necessary
```

This error occurred even with short passwords (8 characters), indicating a bug in the passlib bcrypt wrapper.

## Root Cause
The issue was with passlib's `CryptContext` wrapper around bcrypt. Version incompatibilities between passlib 1.7.4 and bcrypt 5.0.0 were causing the wrapper to incorrectly handle password hashing.

## Solution
1. **Downgraded bcrypt**: From 5.0.0 to 4.0.1 for better stability
2. **Used bcrypt directly**: Bypassed passlib's wrapper and used bcrypt library directly

### Changes Made

#### `/home/dan_wsl/jaydeelew/CompareAI/backend/app/auth.py`

```python
import bcrypt

def get_password_hash(password: str) -> str:
    """Hash a password using bcrypt directly."""
    try:
        password_bytes = password.encode('utf-8')
        salt = bcrypt.gensalt(rounds=12)
        hashed = bcrypt.hashpw(password_bytes, salt)
        print(f"Successfully hashed password (length: {len(password)} chars)")
        return hashed.decode('utf-8')
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error hashing password: {e}")
        raise

def verify_password(plain_password: str, hashed_password: str) -> bool:
    """Verify a plain password against its hashed version."""
    try:
        password_bytes = plain_password.encode('utf-8')
        hashed_bytes = hashed_password.encode('utf-8')
        return bcrypt.checkpw(password_bytes, hashed_bytes)
    except Exception:
        # Fallback to passlib for backwards compatibility
        return pwd_context.verify(plain_password, hashed_password)
```

## Testing
Registration now works successfully:
```bash
$ python test_register.py
Status Code: 201
✅ Registration successful!
```

## Current Status
✅ Backend running on http://localhost:8000
✅ Frontend running on http://localhost:5173
✅ Registration endpoint working
✅ Password hashing functional
✅ User authentication ready

## Next Steps
- Test registration through the frontend UI
- Test login functionality
- Verify token refresh works
- Test protected routes

## Dependencies
- bcrypt==4.0.1 (downgraded from 5.0.0)
- passlib==1.7.4 (kept for backwards compatibility)
