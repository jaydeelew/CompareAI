## 🎯 When to Use Overages vs Upgrade

### Occasional Spikes → Use Overages ✅
**Scenario:** Usually use 20 comparisons/day, occasionally need 35

**On Starter:**
- Most days: $0 overage
- Busy days: 10 overages × $0.20 = $2.00
- **Monthly cost:** ~$14.99 + $4.00 = **$18.99**

**Verdict:** Stay on Starter, use overages as needed

---

### Consistent High Usage → Upgrade ✅
**Scenario:** Consistently need 45 comparisons/day

**Option A - Starter + Overages:**
- Daily overages: 20 × $0.20 = $4.00/day
- Monthly overages: $4.00 × 30 = $120
- **Total:** $14.99 + $120 = **$134.99/month** 😱

**Option B - Upgrade to Pro:**
- **Total:** **$29.99/month** 🎉
- **Savings:** $105/month

**Verdict:** Upgrade to Pro immediately!
