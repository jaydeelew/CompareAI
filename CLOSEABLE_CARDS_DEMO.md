# Closeable Results Cards Feature

## Overview
The comparison results cards are now individually closeable, allowing users to focus on the most relevant model responses by hiding unwanted results.

## How It Works

### üéØ **Key Features**
- **Individual Close Buttons**: Each result card has an "‚úï" button in the top-right corner
- **Visible Results Counter**: Shows how many results are currently visible vs total
- **Show All Results Button**: Appears when cards are closed, allowing users to restore all hidden results
- **Auto-Reset**: Closed cards are automatically restored when a new comparison is run

### üéÆ **User Experience**

1. **Running a Comparison**
   - Enter your text prompt
   - Select multiple AI models
   - Click "Compare Models"

2. **Closing Individual Results**
   - Each result card displays a small "‚úï" button in the header
   - Click the "‚úï" to close/hide that specific result card
   - The card disappears immediately from view

3. **Tracking Hidden Results**
   - The metadata section shows "Results Visible: X/Y" where:
     - X = currently visible results
     - Y = total results generated
   - The main header shows a "Show All Results (N hidden)" button when cards are closed

4. **Restoring Results**
   - Click "Show All Results" to restore all closed cards
   - Running a new comparison automatically restores all cards

### üé® **Visual Design**
- Close button has a subtle gray color that turns red on hover
- Smooth animations for button interactions
- Responsive design that works on mobile devices
- Consistent with the overall app design language

### üì± **Mobile Responsive**
- Close buttons remain accessible on smaller screens
- Button layout adjusts appropriately for mobile view
- Touch-friendly button sizes

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
const [closedCards, setClosedCards] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());
```

### Key Functions
- `closeResultCard(modelId: string)`: Adds a model ID to the closed cards set
- `showAllResults()`: Clears the closed cards set
- Results filtering: `Object.entries(response.results).filter(([modelId]) => !closedCards.has(modelId))`

### CSS Classes
- `.close-card-btn`: Styling for the close button
- `.result-actions`: Container for stats and close button
- Responsive design in `@media (max-width: 768px)`

## Use Cases

### üîç **Focused Analysis**
- Close poor-performing models to focus on successful responses
- Hide error results to concentrate on working models
- Compare only the most relevant models for your use case

### üßπ **Declutter Interface**
- Remove models with very long or verbose responses
- Hide duplicate or similar responses
- Create a cleaner view for screenshots or presentations

### ‚ö° **Performance Optimization**
- Reduce visual complexity when many models are compared
- Improve page scrolling performance with fewer rendered cards
- Better mobile experience with limited screen space

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for this feature:
- **Keyboard shortcuts** (e.g., 'x' key to close focused card)
- **Bulk operations** (close all failed results, close all by provider)
- **Persist preferences** across browser sessions
- **Minimize instead of close** (collapse to title bar only)
- **Export visible results** only

## Accessibility

- Close buttons include proper `aria-label` attributes
- Keyboard navigation support for close buttons
- Screen reader friendly announcements
- High contrast hover states for visibility
