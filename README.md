## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [OpenRouter API Key](https://openrouter.ai/) for AI model access
- (Optional) Domain name for SSL deployment

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaydeelew/CompareAI.git
cd CompareAI
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory:

```env
# backend/.env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
```

> **🔑 API Key:** Get your free OpenRouter API key at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/)

### 3. Development Setup

Choose your development environment:

#### Option A: Standard Development (Recommended)
```bash
# Start with hot reload and development features
docker compose up --build
```
- **Frontend:** [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- **Backend API:** [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

#### Option B: HTTPS Development
```bash
# For testing SSL-dependent features
./create-dev-ssl.sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev-ssl.yml up --build
```
- **Frontend:** [https://localhost:8443](https://localhost:8443)

### 4. Using the Application

1. **Open the web interface** at your chosen URL
2. **Enter your text prompt** in the input field
3. **Select AI models** from the organized provider dropdowns
4. **Click "Compare Models"** to see side-by-side results
5. **Review responses** with performance metrics and success indicators

**💡 Pro Tips:**
- Use "Top 5" button for quick comparisons
- Select 15 or fewer models for optimal performance
- Check the model statistics endpoint for reliability data

## 🌐 Production Deployment

### AWS EC2 Deployment with SSL

**Automated Setup:**
```bash
# For compareintel.com (preconfigured)
./setup-compareintel-ssl.sh

# For custom domains
./setup-ssl.sh yourdomain.com your@email.com
```

**Manual Deployment:**
```bash
# Deploy production environment
./deploy.sh
```

The deployment script automatically:
- ✅ Detects and uses SSL certificates if available
- ✅ Falls back to HTTP if SSL is not configured
- ✅ Builds optimized production containers
- ✅ Configures Nginx reverse proxy
- ✅ Sets up proper CORS and security headers

### Environment Options

1. **Local Development (HTTP):** `docker compose up`
2. **Local Development (HTTPS):** `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev-ssl.yml up`
3. **Production (HTTP):** `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up`
4. **Production (HTTPS):** `docker compose -f docker-compose.ssl.yml up`

> 📋 **For detailed deployment workflows:** See [DEV_WORKFLOW.md](DEV_WORKFLOW.md)
