## 💰 Break-Even Analysis

### How much can users actually use before we lose money?

| Tier | Break-Even Comparisons/Month | Daily Equivalent | % of Daily Limit | Break-Even Usage % |
|------|------------------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Starter** | 149.9 (at max 6 models) | 5 comparisons | 5 of 25 | **20%** ✅ |
| **Pro** | 201.3 (at max 9 models) | 6.7 comparisons | 6.7 of 50 | **13.4%** ✅ |
| **Pro+** | 249.95 (at max 12 models) | 8.3 comparisons | 8.3 of 100 | **8.3%** ✅ |

### What This Means:

**Starter Tier:**
- Users can use up to **20% of their daily limit** (with max models) and we're still profitable
- At 40% usage with typical model selection → **+$2.99 profit/month**
- At 30% usage → **+$7.49 profit/month**

**Pro Tier:**
- Users can use up to **13.4% of their daily limit** (with max models) and we're still profitable
- At 30% usage with typical model selection → **+$7.49 profit/month**
- Becomes unprofitable if users consistently use >30% capacity

**Pro+ Tier:**
- Users can use up to **8.3% of their daily limit** (with max models) and we're still profitable
- Designed as premium/volume tier
- May need price increase to $69.99 if usage is consistently high

✅ **Clear upgrade incentive** - 3 → 6 models is a 2x increase (compelling value)

### Starter Tier (6 models - UNCHANGED)
✅✅ **PROFITABLE** - Makes money at realistic usage (40% usage = +$2.99/month)  
✅ **Sweet spot pricing** - $14.99 is accessible but not trivial  
✅ **Great value proposition** - 2x the models of Free tier  
✅ **Should be marketing focus** - This is our money-maker

### Pro Tier (9 models)
✅ **Better value** - Increased from 8 to 9 models (50% more than Starter)  
✅ **Clear upgrade path** - 6 → 9 is a meaningful jump  
✅ **Profitable at light usage** - Makes money if users stay under 30% capacity  
⚠️ **May lose money at 40%+ usage** - Acceptable as users may upgrade to Pro+

### Pro+ Tier (12 models - UNCHANGED)

⚠️ **Volume strategy** - Relies on most users being light users  
💡 **Consider $69.99** - Would be profitable at 40% usage
