**Date:** October 22, 2025 (Updated to Model-Based Pricing)  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Conceptual Model Approved | ‚è≥ Implementation Pending  
**Implementation:** Switching from comparison-based to model-response-based pricing

## üéØ Current Tier Structure (MODEL-BASED PRICING)

| Tier                     | Daily Model Responses | Max Models/Comparison | Monthly Price | Status                |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- | --------------------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| **Anonymous (unregistered)** | 10                | 3                     | $0            | ‚úÖ Active             |
| **Free (registered)**    | 20                    | 3                     | $0            | ‚úÖ Active             |
| **Starter**              | 150                   | 6                     | TBD           | ‚è≥ Pricing TBD        |
| **Pro**                  | 450                   | 9                     | TBD           | ‚è≥ Pricing TBD        |

**Key Changes:**
- ‚úÖ **Model-based limits:** Users are limited by individual model responses, not comparisons
- ‚úÖ **Tiered model access:** Higher tiers can compare more models simultaneously (3/3/6/9)
- ‚úÖ **Registration incentive:** Registered free users get 2x the capacity of unregistered users
- ‚úÖ **Fair pricing:** Users pay for what they actually use
- ‚úÖ **Clear upgrade path:** More models + more daily capacity at each tier
- ‚è≥ **Pricing pending:** Subscription and overage pricing to be determined

**Rationale for Model-Based Pricing:**

The comparison-based model created unfair pricing tiers where:
- A user comparing 1 model paid the same as someone comparing 6-9 models
- Inconsistent markup (68% to 1500%) depending on usage patterns
- Users were incentivized to always max out their model selection
- Complex user experience with two separate limits to track

The model-based approach:
- ‚úÖ Users pay proportionally to actual AI usage
- ‚úÖ Fair and transparent pricing aligned with costs
- ‚úÖ Simpler to understand: "X model responses per day"
- ‚úÖ Encourages efficient usage patterns
- ‚úÖ Industry-standard approach (similar to token-based pricing)

## üí∞ Cost Analysis (Model-Based)

### Base Cost Structure:

| Metric                    | Value    | Notes                           |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Cost per model call**   | $0.0166  | OpenRouter unified API cost     |
| **Target profit margin**  | 200%     | Industry-standard for SaaS      |
| **Proposed overage price**| $0.05    | Per individual model response   |

### Tier Calculations (Based on Average Usage Patterns):

**Anonymous (Unregistered) Users:**
- 10 model responses/day with 3 models max = ~3 comparisons with 3 models
- Monthly cost to us: 10 √ó 30 √ó $0.0166 = $4.98/month
- Revenue: $0 (free tier)
- Purpose: Allow trial without registration barrier
- Limitation: 3 models max encourages registration for same limit with 2x capacity

**Free (Registered) Users:**
- 20 model responses/day with 3 models max = ~6 comparisons with 3 models
- Monthly cost to us: 20 √ó 30 √ó $0.0166 = $9.96/month
- Revenue: $0 (free tier)
- Business model: Conversion funnel to paid tiers (2x capacity incentivizes registration)
- Limitation: Still 3 models max; upgrading unlocks more models per comparison

**Starter Tier (Pricing TBD):**
- 150 model responses/day with 6 models max = ~25 comparisons with 6 models average
- Monthly cost to us: 150 √ó 30 √ó $0.0166 = $74.70/month
- Requires pricing to achieve target margins
- Benefit: 2x model capacity (3 ‚Üí 6) + 7.5x daily responses (20 ‚Üí 150)

**Pro Tier (Pricing TBD):**
- 450 model responses/day with 9 models max = ~50 comparisons with 9 models average  
- Monthly cost to us: 450 √ó 30 √ó $0.0166 = $224.10/month
- Requires pricing to achieve target margins
- Benefit: 3x model capacity (3 ‚Üí 9) + 22.5x daily responses (20 ‚Üí 450)

## üìä Advantages Over Comparison-Based Pricing

### 1. **Fair Cost Alignment**

**Old Model (Comparison-Based):**
- Starter overage: $0.20 per comparison (covers up to 6 models)
  - 1 model used: 1200% markup ($0.20 vs $0.0166 cost)
  - 6 models used: 100% markup ($0.20 vs $0.10 cost)
- Pro overage: $0.25 per comparison (covers up to 9 models)
  - 1 model used: 1500% markup ($0.25 vs $0.0166 cost)
  - 9 models used: 68% markup ($0.25 vs $0.149 cost)

**New Model (Model-Based):**
- Every model response: $0.05 per model
  - Consistent 200% markup ($0.05 vs $0.0166 cost)
  - Fair regardless of usage pattern
  - Predictable profitability

### 2. **Better User Experience**

**Comparison-Based Issues:**
- Users must understand two separate limits (comparisons AND models per comparison)
- Different model limits per tier create confusion
- Incentivizes wasteful behavior (always selecting max models)

**Model-Based Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Single, simple metric: "model responses remaining"
- ‚úÖ All tiers have same capability (9 models max)
- ‚úÖ Users encouraged to use only what they need
- ‚úÖ Clear value proposition: "pay per AI response"

### 3. **Flexible Usage Patterns**

Users can optimize their usage:
- Quick test with 1 model: 1 model response used
- Compare 3 top choices: 3 model responses used
- Comprehensive analysis with 9 models: 9 model responses used
- Natural scaling based on task complexity

### 4. **Simplified Tier Differentiation**

| Feature                  | Free | Starter | Pro  |
| ------------------------ | ---- | ------- | ---- |
| Daily model responses    | 30   | 150     | 450  |
| Models per comparison    | 9    | 9       | 9    |
| Overage allowed          | ‚ùå   | ‚úÖ      | ‚úÖ   |
| Overage price            | N/A  | TBD     | TBD  |

All tiers have the same **capabilities**, just different **capacity**.

## üìà Profitability Analysis (Conceptual)

### Cost Structure (Known):

- Cost per model response: $0.0166
- Target overage markup: 200% (industry standard)
- Proposed overage price: $0.05/model response

### Example Heavy User Analysis:

**Heavy User on Pro Tier:**
- Daily usage: 450 model responses (at limit)
- Monthly usage: 450 √ó 30 = 13,500 model responses
- Cost to us: 13,500 √ó $0.0166 = $224.10
- Revenue: Pro tier subscription price (TBD)
- Profit: Revenue - $224.10

**Heavy User with Overages:**
- Daily usage: 600 model responses (150 overage)
- Monthly usage: 450 √ó 30 = 13,500 included + 150 √ó 30 = 4,500 overage
- Total: 18,000 model responses
- Cost to us: 18,000 √ó $0.0166 = $298.80
- Revenue: Pro subscription + (4,500 √ó $0.05) = Pro subscription + $225
- Overage profit: $225 - ($298.80 - $224.10) = $225 - $74.70 = **$150.30**
- **Excellent profitability with 200% margin maintained ‚úÖ**

---

## üìä Migration from Comparison-Based Pricing

### Backwards Compatibility:

For existing users during transition:
- Current `daily_usage_count` values will be recalibrated
- Users grandfathered at equivalent capacity
- Clear communication about changes
- Opt-in to new system or maintain legacy limits (short term)

### Translation Table:

| Old Tier    | Old Limit            | New Equivalent           | Notes                       |
| ----------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Anonymous   | 5 comparisons        | 10 model responses       | Based on 2 models avg       |
| Free        | 10 comparisons       | 20 model responses       | Based on 2 models avg       |
| Starter     | 25 comparisons       | 150 model responses      | Based on 6 models avg       |
| Pro         | 50 comparisons       | 450 model responses      | Based on 9 models avg       |

**Note:** The new limits are more conservative for free tiers to encourage upgrades while still providing meaningful trial capacity.

### User Communication:

**Key Messages:**
1. ‚úÖ "More flexibility - use models efficiently to get more comparisons"
2. ‚úÖ "Fairer pricing - pay only for what you use"
3. ‚úÖ "All tiers now support up to 9 models per comparison"
4. ‚úÖ "Same capacity for typical usage patterns"
5. ‚úÖ "More transparency in billing"
