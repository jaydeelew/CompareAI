### ✅ Step 1: Identify the coefficients

The standard form of a quadratic equation is:  

**ax² + bx + c = 0**

From our equation:  

- **a = 2** (coefficient of x²)  

- **b = 5** (coefficient of x)  

- **c = -3** (constant term)

### ✅ Step 2: Write down the quadratic formula

The quadratic formula is:

\[
x = \frac{{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}}{{2a}}
\]

We'll plug in the values of **a**, **b**, and **c**.
