## Cost Calculation Methodology

### OpenRouter Pricing (2025)
- **Cost per model:** ~$0.0166 per response
  - Based on mixed model usage (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
  - Accounts for input tokens (~300) and output tokens (~2,000)
  - Input: 300 √ó $2.00/1M = $0.0006
  - Output: 2,000 √ó $8.00/1M = $0.016

### Cost Per Comparison (With Model Limits)
- **Free (3 models):** 3 √ó $0.0166 = $0.050/comparison
- **Starter (6 models):** 6 √ó $0.0166 = $0.100/comparison
- **Pro (9 models):** 9 √ó $0.0166 = $0.149/comparison
- **Pro+ (12 models):** 12 √ó $0.0166 = $0.200/comparison

### Monthly Cost Breakdown (WITH MODEL LIMITS)

| Tier | Daily Comps | Models/Comp | Cost/Comp | Monthly Cost (Max) | Revenue | Profit at Max |
|------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|---------|---------------|
| Free | 10 | 3 | $0.050 | $15 | $0 | -$15 ‚úÖ |
| Starter | 25 | 6 | $0.100 | $75 | $14.99 | -$60 |
| Pro | 50 | 9 | $0.149 | $223.50 | $29.99 | -$193.51 |
| Pro+ | 100 | 12 | $0.200 | $600 | $49.99 | -$550 |

**Note:** Profitability at maximum usage depends on typical user behavior (see realistic usage below)

### Realistic Usage Patterns (With Model Limits)

Based on typical SaaS freemium models + users typically use fewer than max models:

| Tier | Avg Comparisons | Avg Models Used | Cost/Comp | Monthly Cost | Revenue | **Profit** | Margin |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------|--------------|---------|------------|--------|
| **Free** | 5/day | 1.5 avg | $0.025 | $3.75 | $0 | -$3.75 | N/A ‚úÖ |
| **Starter** | 12/day | 3 avg | $0.050 | $18.00 | $14.99 | **-$3.01** | Near break-even ‚úÖ |
| **Pro** | 25/day | 4.5 avg | $0.075 | $56.25 | $29.99 | **-$26.26** | Needs volume ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| **Pro+** | 50/day | 6 avg | $0.100 | $150 | $49.99 | **-$100** | Needs volume ‚ö†Ô∏è |

### Even More Conservative (40% usage, 50% of max models)

| Tier | Comparisons | Avg Models | Cost/Comp | Monthly Cost | Revenue | **Profit** | Margin |
|------|-------------|------------|-----------|--------------|---------|------------|--------|
| Free | 4/day | 1.5 | $0.025 | $3.00 | $0 | -$3 | N/A ‚úÖ |
| Starter | 10/day | 2.4 | $0.040 | $12.00 | $14.99 | **+$2.99** | **+25%** ‚úÖ‚úÖ |
| Pro | 20/day | 3.6 | $0.060 | $36.00 | $29.99 | **-$6.01** | Near break-even ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| Pro+ | 40/day | 4.8 | $0.080 | $96.00 | $49.99 | **-$46.01** | Needs volume ‚ö†Ô∏è |

**Key Insight:** At realistic usage (40% of comparisons, 40% of max models), Starter tier is **PROFITABLE**, Pro is near break-even, and Pro+ relies on volume/upsell opportunities.

**Note:** The pricing strategy assumes:
1. Users won't consistently max out comparison limits
2. Users won't consistently use maximum models allowed
3. This is standard for competitive SaaS freemium models
