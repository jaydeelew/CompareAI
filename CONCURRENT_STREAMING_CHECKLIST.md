## Deployment Steps

### 1. Local Testing

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start backend
cd backend
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Terminal 2: Run test
cd backend
python test_concurrent_streaming.py

# Expected: âœ… VERDICT: Streaming is CONCURRENT! ðŸŽ‰
```

- [ ] Test passes locally
- [ ] Backend starts without errors
- [ ] No warnings in logs

### 2. Browser Testing

```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend running (from step 1)

# Terminal 2: Start frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev

# Open: http://localhost:5173
```

Manual checks:

- [ ] Select 3+ models
- [ ] Submit a prompt
- [ ] All model cards show AI header at same time
- [ ] Text appears in multiple cards simultaneously
- [ ] Different end times per model
- [ ] Total time â‰ˆ slowest model time

### 3. Commit Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement concurrent model streaming for 3-9x performance improvement

- Refactor /compare-stream endpoint to process models concurrently
- Use asyncio.create_task for parallel execution
- Implement thread-safe queue for chunk collection
- Add comprehensive test suite
- Update documentation and diagrams
- Remove premature 'concurrent processing' UI claim

Performance: 3-9x faster response times
- 3 models: 15s â†’ 5s (3x)
- 6 models: 30s â†’ 6s (5x)
- 9 models: 45s â†’ 7s (6.4x)

Backward compatible: No frontend changes required"

git push
```

- [ ] Git commit created
- [ ] Changes pushed to repository

### 4. Production Deployment

```bash
# SSH into production server
ssh user@production-server

# Pull latest changes
cd /path/to/CompareAI
git pull

# Restart backend service
sudo systemctl restart compareintel-backend

# Or if using PM2:
pm2 restart compareintel-backend

# Check logs
sudo journalctl -u compareintel-backend -f
# Or: pm2 logs compareintel-backend
```

- [ ] Changes pulled to production
- [ ] Backend service restarted
- [ ] No errors in startup logs
- [ ] Service is running and healthy

### 5. Production Verification

```bash
# From local machine, test production endpoint
python test_concurrent_streaming.py https://api.compareintel.com

# Or manual browser test at: https://compareintel.com
```

Production checks:

- [ ] Test script passes against production
- [ ] Browser test: models stream concurrently
- [ ] No errors in production logs
- [ ] Response times improved
- [ ] All selected models complete successfully

---

## Smoke Testing

### Quick Health Checks

1. **Backend Health**

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   # Expected: {"status": "healthy"}
   ```

   - [ ] Health endpoint responds

2. **Models Endpoint**

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/models
   # Expected: JSON list of available models
   ```

   - [ ] Models list returns successfully

3. **Single Model Test**

   ```bash
   python test_streaming.py
   # Expected: âœ… Streaming test completed successfully!
   ```

   - [ ] Single model streaming works

4. **Concurrent Test**
   ```bash
   python test_concurrent_streaming.py
   # Expected: âœ… VERDICT: Streaming is CONCURRENT!
   ```
   - [ ] Concurrent streaming works

---

## Performance Monitoring

### Metrics to Track

1. **Response Times**

   - Before: 15-45 seconds (3-9 models)
   - After: 5-7 seconds (3-9 models)
   - [ ] Improvement verified

2. **Error Rates**

   - Monitor for increased errors
   - [ ] Error rate unchanged or improved

3. **Resource Usage**

   - CPU usage during concurrent requests
   - Memory consumption
   - [ ] Resources within acceptable limits

4. **User Feedback**
   - Monitor user reports
   - [ ] No complaints about streaming

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur in production:

### Step 1: Immediate Rollback

```bash
# SSH to production
ssh user@production-server

# Revert to previous commit
cd /path/to/CompareAI
git log  # Find previous commit hash
git revert HEAD  # Or: git reset --hard <previous-commit>

# Restart service
sudo systemctl restart compareintel-backend
```

### Step 2: Verify Rollback

```bash
# Test that old (sequential) behavior works
python test_streaming.py https://api.compareintel.com
```

- [ ] Rollback completed
- [ ] Service running normally
- [ ] Old behavior restored

### Step 3: Investigate

- [ ] Check logs for error messages
- [ ] Review test output
- [ ] Identify root cause
- [ ] Fix and re-test locally
- [ ] Re-deploy when fixed
