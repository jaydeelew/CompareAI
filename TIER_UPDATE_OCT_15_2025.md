## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements:
1. **Registration prompt modal:** Show after 3rd comparison (before hitting limit)
2. **Email reminders:** Notify registered users when approaching daily limit
3. **Referral program:** Give extra comparisons for referring friends
4. **Social proof:** Show "X users upgraded today" to encourage conversions
5. **A/B testing:** Test different unregistered limits (3, 5, 7) for optimal conversion
6. **Grace period:** Allow 1-2 comparisons over limit to avoid frustration
7. **Reset timer display:** Show time until daily limit resets

### Analytics to Track:
- Unregistered → Registered conversion rate
- Average comparisons per unregistered user before registering
- Average comparisons per registered free user before upgrading
- Time to conversion (unregistered → registered)
- Churn rate by tier

## Support & Communication

### User Communication Plan:
1. **Website banner:** "Register for FREE to get 2x daily comparisons!"
2. **Limit reached message:** Clear call-to-action to register
3. **Email to existing users:** Explain the change and benefits
4. **Social media posts:** Announce improved registration benefits
5. **FAQ update:** Add "Why should I register?" section

### Support Team Talking Points:
- Registration is 100% free, no credit card required
- Registered users get 2x the comparisons (10 vs 5)
- Easy to upgrade to paid plans if needed
- All existing features remain available on free tier
- No changes for current registered users
