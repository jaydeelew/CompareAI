# 🔧 Streaming Spaces Fix

## Problem

Words were being concatenated together during streaming responses, with no spaces between them. For example:

```
"Here's a cleanPythonimplementation of mergesort"
```

Instead of:

```
"Here's a clean Python implementation of mergesort"
```

## Root Cause

The issue was in the streaming endpoint (`backend/app/main.py`), where `clean_model_response()` was being called on **each individual chunk** as it arrived from the model.

### Why This Broke Spaces

The `clean_model_response()` function does important cleanup (removing MathML junk, excessive whitespace), but it also calls `text.strip()` at the end. When applied to individual chunks, this caused a critical problem:

```python
# Example of what was happening:
# Chunk 1: "Here's a clean " → after strip() → "Here's a clean" (trailing space removed!)
# Chunk 2: "Python implementation" → stays the same
# Result when concatenated: "Here's a cleanPython implementation" ❌
```

The trailing space in Chunk 1 was being stripped away, causing it to concatenate directly with Chunk 2.

### The Bug

```python:612:621:backend/app/main.py
# OLD CODE (broken):
for chunk in stream_chunks():
    # Clean the chunk before sending
    cleaned_chunk = clean_model_response(chunk) if chunk else ""  # ❌ BUG!
    model_content += cleaned_chunk
    chunk_count += 1
    
    # Send chunk event immediately
    chunk_data = f"data: {json.dumps({'model': model_id, 'type': 'chunk', 'content': cleaned_chunk})}\n\n"
    yield chunk_data
```

## The Fix

### 1. Stop cleaning individual chunks

Individual chunks should be sent **exactly as received** to preserve spaces at chunk boundaries:

```python:612:621:backend/app/main.py
# NEW CODE (fixed):
for chunk in stream_chunks():
    # Don't clean chunks during streaming - cleaning strips whitespace which breaks word boundaries!
    # The chunk is sent exactly as received to preserve spaces between words
    model_content += chunk  # ✅ No cleaning!
    chunk_count += 1
    
    # Send chunk event immediately
    chunk_data = f"data: {json.dumps({'model': model_id, 'type': 'chunk', 'content': chunk})}\n\n"
    yield chunk_data
```

### 2. Clean the final accumulated content

After all chunks have been received, clean the complete response once:

```python:630:633:backend/app/main.py
# Clean the final accumulated content (after streaming is complete)
# This removes MathML junk and excessive whitespace
model_content = clean_model_response(model_content)
```

### 3. Updated function documentation

Added a warning to the `clean_model_response()` function:

```python:432:440:backend/app/model_runner.py
def clean_model_response(text: str) -> str:
    """
    Lightweight cleanup for model responses.
    Heavy cleanup moved to frontend LatexRenderer for better performance.
    
    NOTE: This function strips leading/trailing whitespace, which is fine for
    complete responses but should NOT be used on streaming chunks (it would
    remove spaces between words at chunk boundaries).
    """
```

## Impact

- ✅ Spaces between words are now preserved correctly
- ✅ Streaming still works at full speed
- ✅ MathML and excessive whitespace cleanup still happens (on final result)
- ✅ No changes needed to frontend or other code

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Ask any AI model a question that requires a multi-word response
2. Watch the streaming output in the "Raw" tab
3. Verify that spaces appear between words as the response streams in

Example test query: "give me a python implementation of mergesort"

Expected result: Properly spaced text like "Here's a clean Python implementation of mergesort"
