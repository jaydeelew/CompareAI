# Future Context Optimizations - Prompt Caching & Summarization

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Status:** 📋 Planning Document  
**Current Implementation:** Context Management v1.0 (Truncation-based)  
**Next Steps:** Monitor → Data-Driven Decision → Implement If Needed

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

This document outlines two potential optimizations to the current context management system:
1. **Prompt Caching** - Reduce costs by 50-90% on repeated context
2. **Conversation Summarization** - Maintain context quality beyond truncation limits

**Recommendation:** Deploy current system first, monitor for 4-6 weeks, then implement based on actual usage data.

---

## 📊 Current State (Baseline)

### What We Have Now (v1.0)
- ✅ Automatic truncation at 20 messages (backend)
- ✅ Hard limit at 24 messages (frontend)
- ✅ Progressive warnings (10, 14, 20, 24 messages)
- ✅ Extended interaction tracking (>10 messages)
- ✅ Transparent cost display
- ✅ Educational user messaging

### Known Limitations
- ⚠️ Context lost after 20 messages (truncation)
- ⚠️ No cost optimization for repeated context
- ⚠️ All context tokens charged at full price
- ⚠️ Binary truncation (keep/discard, no summarization)

### Current Costs Per Conversation
```
Short (1-10 messages):    1-4× base cost  = $0.017-$0.066
Medium (11-20 messages):  5-7× base cost  = $0.083-$0.116
Long (21-24 messages):    Capped at 7×    = $0.116 (truncated)
```

## 🚀 Optimization #1: Prompt Caching

### What Is Prompt Caching?

Prompt caching allows you to cache conversation history tokens so they don't need to be reprocessed on every follow-up request. Major providers offer significant discounts for cached tokens.

### How It Works

```
First Request:
User: "What is machine learning?"
→ Full context sent: 100 tokens @ $0.01/1K = $0.001
→ Response: 200 tokens

Second Request (WITHOUT caching):
User: "Can you give an example?"
→ Context sent: 100 (previous) + 200 (response) + 50 (new) = 350 tokens @ $0.01/1K = $0.0035
→ Response: 200 tokens

Second Request (WITH caching):
User: "Can you give an example?"
→ Cached: 300 tokens @ $0.001/1K = $0.0003 (90% discount!)
→ New: 50 tokens @ $0.01/1K = $0.0005
→ Total input cost: $0.0008 (77% savings)
```

### Provider Support

| Provider | Cache Support | Discount | Cache TTL | Notes |
|----------|--------------|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Anthropic Claude** | ✅ Yes | 90% off cached | 5 minutes | `cache_control` parameter |
| **OpenAI GPT-4** | ✅ Yes | 50% off cached | Unknown | Automatic in some cases |
| **OpenRouter** | ❓ Unknown | Varies | Varies | **Need to verify per model** |
| **Google Gemini** | ✅ Yes | Free for context | Session | Built-in context caching |
| **Mistral** | ⚠️ Partial | Varies | Varies | Model-dependent |

### Implementation Complexity

**Effort Level:** 🟡 Medium (2-3 hours)

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Check OpenRouter Support** (30 mins)
```python
# Test if OpenRouter passes through cache_control
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet",
    messages=messages,
    extra_body={
        "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}
    }
)
```

2. **Add Cache Control Logic** (1 hour)
```python
def build_cached_messages(conversation_history):
    """Mark conversation history for caching"""
    messages = []
    
    # Add conversation history with cache marker
    for i, msg in enumerate(conversation_history):
        message = {"role": msg.role, "content": msg.content}
        
        # Mark last history message for caching
        if i == len(conversation_history) - 1:
            message["cache_control"] = {"type": "ephemeral"}
        
        messages.append(message)
    
    return messages
```

3. **Update API Calls** (30 mins)
```python
# In call_openrouter_streaming()
if conversation_history and supports_caching(model_id):
    messages = build_cached_messages(conversation_history)
```

4. **Add Model Support Detection** (30 mins)
```python
CACHING_SUPPORTED_MODELS = [
    "anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet",
    "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4",
    # Add models as verified
]

def supports_caching(model_id: str) -> bool:
    return model_id in CACHING_SUPPORTED_MODELS
```

5. **Test & Validate** (30 mins)
- Verify cache headers in API response
- Confirm cost reduction in billing
- Test cache TTL behavior

### Expected Impact

**Best Case Scenario:**
- 50-90% reduction in input token costs
- Applies to conversations with >2 follow-ups
- Bigger savings on longer conversations

**Example Savings:**
```
20-message conversation, 3 models:
Without caching: $0.35 total input cost
With caching (90%): $0.035 cached + $0.035 new = $0.07 (80% savings)

Across 1000 conversations/day:
Without: $350/day = $10,500/month
With: $70/day = $2,100/month
SAVINGS: $8,400/month 💰
```

**Realistic Scenario:**
- Assuming 30% of conversations have >2 follow-ups
- Average 60% cost reduction on those conversations
- **Expected savings: 15-20% of total API costs**

### When to Implement

**✅ Implement Prompt Caching IF:**
- [ ] You have 4+ weeks of production usage data
- [ ] >25% of conversations exceed 10 messages
- [ ] OpenRouter confirms caching support for your models
- [ ] API costs exceed $300/month
- [ ] Cost/benefit analysis shows >$500/month savings potential

**Metrics to Track Before Deciding:**
```sql
-- Conversation length distribution
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN message_count <= 10 THEN '1-10 messages'
        WHEN message_count <= 20 THEN '11-20 messages'
        WHEN message_count <= 30 THEN '21-30 messages'
        ELSE '30+ messages'
    END as length_bucket,
    COUNT(*) as conversations,
    ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 2) as percentage
FROM conversation_logs
GROUP BY length_bucket;

-- Average follow-ups per conversation
SELECT 
    AVG(follow_up_count) as avg_follow_ups,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY follow_up_count) as median_follow_ups,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY follow_up_count) as p95_follow_ups
FROM conversation_logs;
```

### Implementation Priority

**Priority:** 🟡 Medium  
**Timeline:** Week 4-6 after v1.0 deployment  
**Dependencies:** OpenRouter caching support verification  
**Risk:** Low (graceful fallback if not supported)  
**ROI:** High IF conversations are long

## 🤖 Optimization #2: Conversation Summarization

### What Is Conversation Summarization?

Instead of truncating old messages, summarize them into a concise context block. This maintains conversation continuity while managing token count.

### How It Works

```
Without Summarization (Current):
[Truncate messages 1-10] → Keep messages 11-20 → Add new prompt
❌ Loses context from messages 1-10

With Summarization:
[Summarize messages 1-10] → Keep messages 11-20 verbatim → Add new prompt
✅ Maintains high-level context from entire conversation
```

### Example

**Original Messages 1-10 (~1500 tokens):**
```
User: What is machine learning?
AI: Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables...
User: Can you give examples?
AI: Sure! Here are three main types: 1) Supervised...
User: How does supervised learning work?
AI: In supervised learning, you have labeled data...
[... 5 more exchanges]
```

**Summarized (~150 tokens, 90% reduction):**
```
[Conversation Summary]
User asked about machine learning fundamentals. Discussion covered:
- Definition of ML as AI subset enabling computers to learn from data
- Three main types: supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning  
- Detailed explanation of supervised learning with labeled datasets
- Examples including image classification and regression models
- User particularly interested in practical applications
```

### Implementation Approaches

#### **Option A: Simple Summarization** 🟢 (Recommended First)

**Effort:** Medium (4-6 hours)

```python
def summarize_old_messages(old_messages: list) -> str:
    """
    Summarize old conversation context using a cheap, fast model
    """
    # Concatenate old messages
    conversation_text = "\n".join([
        f"{msg.role}: {msg.content}" 
        for msg in old_messages
    ])
    
    # Use fast, cheap model for summarization
    summary_prompt = f"""Summarize this conversation in 3-4 concise sentences, 
    capturing the main topics discussed and any important context:

{conversation_text}

Summary:"""
    
    # Use cheaper model (e.g., GPT-3.5-turbo or Claude Haiku)
    summary = call_summarization_model(summary_prompt)
    
    return summary

def build_context_with_summary(conversation_history: list, max_messages: int = 20):
    """
    Build context with summarization instead of truncation
    """
    if len(conversation_history) <= max_messages:
        return conversation_history, False
    
    # Split into old (to summarize) and recent (keep verbatim)
    split_point = len(conversation_history) - max_messages
    old_messages = conversation_history[:split_point]
    recent_messages = conversation_history[split_point:]
    
    # Summarize old messages
    summary = summarize_old_messages(old_messages)
    
    # Build new context
    context = [
        {"role": "system", "content": f"Previous conversation summary: {summary}"}
    ]
    context.extend([
        {"role": msg.role, "content": msg.content}
        for msg in recent_messages
    ])
    
    return context, True
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Maintains conversation continuity
- ✅ Better UX than hard truncation
- ✅ Simple to implement
- ✅ Works with any model

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Extra API call for summarization ($0.001-0.003 per summary)
- ⚠️ Slight delay (200-500ms for summary)
- ⚠️ May lose nuanced details
- ⚠️ Summary quality varies

#### **Option B: Advanced Summarization** 🔴 (Complex)

**Effort:** High (2-3 days)

**Features:**
- Semantic chunking (group related exchanges)
- Importance scoring (keep critical details)
- Multi-tier summarization (progressive detail levels)
- User control (mark important messages)
- Entity tracking (preserve names, dates, key facts)

**Implementation Complexity:**
```python
# Requires:
- Embeddings for semantic similarity
- NLP library (spaCy or similar)
- Custom importance scoring algorithm
- Persistent storage for summaries
- UI for user control
- Rollback mechanism if summary fails
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Best context retention
- ✅ Intelligent preservation of important details
- ✅ Scales to very long conversations

**Cons:**
- ❌ Significant engineering time
- ❌ Additional dependencies
- ❌ Harder to debug/maintain
- ❌ More failure modes

#### **Option C: Hybrid Approach** 🟡 (Balanced)

**Effort:** Medium-High (1-2 days)

Combine truncation + summarization:
- Keep last 15 messages verbatim (most important)
- Summarize messages 11-15 lightly (key points)
- Aggressive summary for messages 1-10 (high level)

```python
def build_hybrid_context(history: list, max_messages: int = 20):
    """
    Three-tier approach: verbatim → light summary → aggressive summary
    """
    if len(history) <= max_messages:
        return history
    
    # Tier 1: Last 10 messages verbatim (most important)
    verbatim = history[-10:]
    
    # Tier 2: Next 5 messages - light summary (keep important details)
    if len(history) > 15:
        medium_old = history[-15:-10]
        medium_summary = light_summarize(medium_old)
    
    # Tier 3: Oldest messages - aggressive summary (high level only)
    if len(history) > 15:
        very_old = history[:-15]
        high_level_summary = aggressive_summarize(very_old)
    
    # Combine
    context = []
    if len(history) > 15:
        context.append({"role": "system", "content": high_level_summary})
    if len(history) > 10:
        context.append({"role": "system", "content": medium_summary})
    context.extend(verbatim)
    
    return context
```

### Expected Impact

**Context Quality:**
```
Truncation only:    60% context retention
Simple summary:     75% context retention  
Advanced summary:   85% context retention
Hybrid approach:    80% context retention
```

**User Experience:**
- Fewer complaints about "forgetting" earlier context
- Smoother long conversations
- Better coherence across many exchanges

**Cost Impact:**
- **Additional cost:** $0.001-0.003 per summary
- **Offset by:** Reduced need for users to re-explain context
- **Net impact:** Roughly neutral (small increase)

### When to Implement

**✅ Implement Summarization IF:**
- [ ] Users explicitly complain about context loss
- [ ] Support tickets mention "AI forgot what we discussed"
- [ ] >10% of conversations hit 20-message truncation
- [ ] User feedback shows truncation hurts quality
- [ ] You have development bandwidth (4+ hours minimum)

**❌ Don't Implement IF:**
- [ ] Current truncation works fine (no complaints)
- [ ] Most conversations stay under 15 messages
- [ ] Users naturally start fresh when needed
- [ ] Engineering time better spent elsewhere

**Metrics to Track Before Deciding:**
```sql
-- How many conversations hit truncation?
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as truncated_conversations,
    ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM conversations), 2) as percentage
FROM conversations
WHERE message_count > 20;

-- Support tickets mentioning context issues
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM support_tickets
WHERE message LIKE '%forgot%' 
   OR message LIKE '%context%'
   OR message LIKE '%remember%';
```

### Implementation Priority

**Priority:** 🔴 Low  
**Timeline:** Only if data shows clear need (Week 8+)  
**Dependencies:** User feedback, usage metrics  
**Risk:** Medium (summarization might lose important details)  
**ROI:** Medium (better UX for power users only)

## 📈 Decision Framework

### Phase 1: Current (Weeks 1-4)
```
✅ Deploy truncation-based context management
✅ Monitor usage patterns
✅ Collect user feedback
✅ Track costs and conversation lengths
```

### Phase 2: Data Review (Week 4-6)
```
📊 Analyze metrics:
   - What % hit 10, 14, 20, 24 message thresholds?
   - Average conversation length?
   - Support tickets about context?
   - API costs trending?

📊 Decision point:
   IF >25% conversations >10 messages AND OpenRouter supports caching
      → Implement Prompt Caching
   
   IF Users complaining about context loss
      → Consider Summarization
   
   ELSE
      → Current system is sufficient ✅
```

### Phase 3: Optimization (Week 6-12)
```
IF implementing caching:
   1. Verify OpenRouter support
   2. Test with one model
   3. Measure cost savings
   4. Roll out to all supported models
   5. Monitor for 2 weeks

IF implementing summarization:
   1. Start with Simple approach (Option A)
   2. Test with internal users
   3. Measure context quality
   4. Deploy to 10% of users (A/B test)
   5. Roll out if metrics improve
```

- ❌ Over-engineer for hypothetical future needs
- ❌ Implement caching without verifying provider support
- ❌ Add features just because competitors have them

**Do:**
- ✅ Make data-driven decisions
- ✅ Start simple, iterate based on feedback
- ✅ Measure impact before scaling
- ✅ Prioritize user complaints over theoretical improvements
- ✅ Consider ROI of engineering time

## 🎓 Key Takeaways

1. **Current system is solid** - Truncation at 20 messages is industry-standard
2. **Prompt caching = high ROI** - IF conversations are long and provider supports it
3. **Summarization = UX improvement** - Only implement if users complain
4. **Data drives decisions** - Monitor first, optimize later
5. **Simple beats complex** - Start with Option A, not Option C
