# Model-Based Pricing Migration

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Ready for Testing  
**Migration Type:** Comparison-based → Model-based pricing

---

## 📋 Summary of Changes

This migration switches CompareAI from **comparison-based** to **model-based** pricing/rate limiting. Users are now limited by individual model responses rather than total comparisons, creating a fairer and more flexible system.

### Key Changes:

1. **Uniform Model Access:** All tiers can now use up to 9 models per comparison
2. **Model Response Tracking:** Each model used counts as one response toward the daily limit
3. **Fair Pricing:** Users pay/consume based on actual AI usage, not comparison count
4. **No Pricing Yet:** Subscription and overage pricing marked as "TBD" - payment not implemented

## 🎯 New Tier Structure

| Tier                         | Daily Model Responses | Max Models/Comparison | Support Response | Chat History | Notes                    |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------- | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| **Anonymous (unregistered)** | 10                    | 3                     | N/A              | N/A          | IP + fingerprint tracked |
| **Free (registered)**        | 20                    | 3                     | N/A              | N/A          | No overages              |
| **Starter**                  | 50                    | 6                     | 48 hours         | 30 days      | Overage available (TBD)  |
| **Starter+**                 | 100                   | 6                     | 48 hours         | 30 days      | Overage available (TBD)  |
| **Pro**                      | 200                   | 9                     | 24 hours         | 60 days      | Overage available (TBD)  |
| **Pro+**                     | 400                   | 9                     | 24 hours         | 90 days      | Overage available (TBD)  |

### Translation from Old System:

| Old System              | New System                      | Equivalent Usage                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Anonymous: 5 comparisons | 10 model responses (unregistered) | ~3 comparisons × 3 models         |
| Free: 10 comparisons    | 20 model responses (registered) | ~6 comparisons × 3 models           |
| Starter: 25 comparisons | 50 model responses              | ~8 comparisons × 6 models           |
| Pro: 50 comparisons     | 200 model responses             | ~22 comparisons × 9 models          |

**Key Benefit:** Registration provides 2x capacity (10 → 20 model responses), creating strong incentive to create a free account.

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Rate Limiting Logic:

**Old System:**
```python
# Increment by 1 per comparison
user.daily_usage_count += 1
```

**New System:**
```python
# Increment by number of models used
num_models = len(req.models)
user.daily_usage_count += num_models
```

### Limit Checking:

**Old System:**
```python
if user.daily_usage_count >= daily_limit:
    raise HTTPException(status_code=429, detail="Daily limit exceeded")
```

**New System:**
```python
num_models = len(req.models)
if user.daily_usage_count + num_models > daily_limit:
    models_available = daily_limit - user.daily_usage_count
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=429,
        detail=f"You have {models_available} remaining but need {num_models}"
    )
```

### Model Limit Enforcement:

**Old System:**
```python
# Different limits per tier
tier_model_limit = get_model_limit(user.subscription_tier)  # 3, 6, or 9
if len(req.models) > tier_model_limit:
    raise HTTPException(...)
```

**New System:**
```python
# Uniform limit for all tiers
MAX_MODELS_PER_COMPARISON = 9
if len(req.models) > MAX_MODELS_PER_COMPARISON:
    raise HTTPException(...)
```

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### 1. Backup Database (Recommended)

```bash
# For SQLite
cp backend/compareai.db backend/compareai.db.backup

# For PostgreSQL
pg_dump compareai > backup.sql
```

### 2. Deploy Backend Changes

```bash
# If using Docker
docker-compose down
docker-compose build backend
docker-compose up -d

# If running locally
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt  # No new dependencies, but ensure up-to-date
# Restart your backend server
```

### 3. Deploy Frontend Changes

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
# Deploy built files to your hosting
```

### 4. Database Migration (Optional)

**Note:** No database schema changes are required. Existing `daily_usage_count` values will be interpreted as model responses going forward.

**Optional: Reset all usage counts for clean start:**

```python
# Run this in a Python shell with your backend environment
from backend.app.database import SessionLocal
from backend.app.models import User

db = SessionLocal()
users = db.query(User).all()
for user in users:
    user.daily_usage_count = 0
    user.monthly_overage_count = 0
db.commit()
print(f"Reset usage for {len(users)} users")
```

### 5. Verify Deployment

```bash
# Test backend health
curl http://your-domain.com/health

# Test rate limit status
curl http://your-domain.com/rate-limit-status

# Make a test comparison with 3 models
# Check that usage increments by 3, not 1
```
