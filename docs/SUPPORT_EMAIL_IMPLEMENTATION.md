## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Email Templates (`backend/app/email_service.py`)
Added support email to the footer of all email templates:
- **Verification Email** - Users see support contact when verifying their account

### 2. Frontend Footer Component (`frontend/src/components/Footer.tsx`)
Created a new reusable Footer component that displays:
- Support email with mailto link
- Copyright notice
- Clean, minimal design matching the app's aesthetic

**Features:**
- Hover effect on email link
- Responsive styling
- Consistent branding

### 3. App Integration (`frontend/src/App.tsx`)
- Imported Footer component
- Added Footer to main app layout (displays on all pages)
- Positioned after main content, before modals

### 4. User Menu Enhancement (`frontend/src/components/auth/UserMenu.tsx`)
Added "Contact Support" menu item:
- Icon: üìß
- Label: "Contact Support"
- Action: Opens user's default email client with `mailto:support@compareintel.com`
- Positioned below Settings, above Sign Out

## User Experience

### For All Users (Registered and Unregistered)
- Footer with support email visible on every page

### For Registered Users
- Additional access via User Menu dropdown
- Easy access from any page without scrolling
- Consistent with other navigation options

### In Email Communications

## Design Decisions

### Why Email Address is Visible
‚úÖ **Transparency** - Shows confidence and openness

‚úÖ **User Preference** - Users can use their preferred email client  
‚úÖ **Thread Management** - Users can track conversations  
‚úÖ **Professional** - Industry standard practice  

### Why Available to All Users

‚úÖ **Problem Resolution** - Users can report signup issues  
‚úÖ **Conversions** - Potential customers can ask questions  

## Zoho Configuration Recommendations
